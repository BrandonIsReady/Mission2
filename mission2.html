   <h2><b> About Me!</b></h2>
   <br> <br>

   <p> Back in 2018, I was working security, and I got to see plenty of amazing things all through New Zealand.<br><br>

    I had worked in the control room for major events, Been backstage of concerts, and was requested to travel to the South Island to assist in securing stadiums for The All Blacks. <br><br>

   In 2019, I signed with Eden Park Trust as an asset protection officer at the young age of 20. I was responsible for making sure everyone was abiding by Health and Saftey requirements, and gaining access through correct means <br><br>

   I've always known that I wanted to work in the I.T industry, but I never really knew how to enter. <br><br>

   I was able to be apart of the team to deliver Eden Park's first concert, I worked nearly 20 hours straight that day <br><br>

   while I was getting to do and see some pretty wild things, it was always mindless work, and I knew I couldnt do it forever <br><br>

   for a while, I worked on certifications through CompTIA that mainly focused on the networking side of the industry, while i enjoyed learning about this, it didnt quite scratch the itch i had. <br><br>

   In March of 2022, I was pointed in the direction of Mission Ready by a family member, I applied for full Stack developer course, and never looked back. <br><br>
